#2017 TSA Encrption Utility 

This is a project that has one goal, To be an all in one encryption utility. This project also for a contest.
The primary lanuge that this is programed in is Java 8 with a little bit of CSS3 thrown in for *style*

##Ok Cool, What is it? What does it do?

This program is (or at least is trying to be) an all-in-one encryption utility. What it does is has the user enter some text that they want to encrypt. Select the encryption algrithem they want to use. Then they enter a password and hit encrypt. The program will then take that user stuff and encrypts it using the method they defined. Then the program will make a output popup box that has the encrypted text and if the user hit decrtpt as well the decrypted text. 

##Sounds interesting.. What algerritums do you support?

As of right now we have created sussefull implementations of 3DES, Base64 (Yeah its a hasher but still), and (the most secure out of all of these) the caesar cyphir. Y
Yeah I know this is not that impressive. But we are hoping to add a few more including AES-256 and RSA. These have not been added yet due to time constraints.

##Oh, Ok. Well when do you expect to have a release out?

Based on our current speed we expect to have a stable release with the minimal set of features out by 12/7/17. 
A build with a more complete set of features, namly more agrithums, won't be out until early 2018.

##Awesome! How can I help?

Sorry, if you are interested in writing some code, you can't. The contest that this program is being entered in does not allow external help. You can however test the program and report bugs, trust us, there are plenty.
