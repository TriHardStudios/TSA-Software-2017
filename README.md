# TSA-Software-2017
Monarch High TSA Project 2017

This is a very poorly implemented project. What it should be doing is allowing the user to choose a agerithum to encrypt a string of text. 

# What is working
We have the first encryption method up. It does what it should as long as you don't need to decrypt what it is you encrypt. 

# Issues
We can't decrypt. There are no comments. I Think the code is very ineffently programed
