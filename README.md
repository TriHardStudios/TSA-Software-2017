2018 TSA Encryption Utility 
=========================

This is a project that has one goal, To be an all in one encryption utility. This project also for a contest.
The primary language that this is programmed in is Java 8 with a little bit of CSS3 thrown in for *style* We will be updating this readme file with information as to how well this programmed in the TSA contest. Wish us Luck!

Ok Cool, What is it? What does it do?
-------------------------------------

This program is (or at least is trying to be) an all-in-one encryption utility. What it does is has the user enter some text that they want to encrypt. Select the encryption algorithm they want to use. Then they enter a password and hit encrypt. The program will then take that user stuff and encrypts it using the method they defined. Then the program will make a output popup box that has the encrypted text and if the user hit decrypt as well the decrypted text. 

Sounds interesting.. What algorithms do you support?
----------------------------------------------------

With the final version (1.5.6) we support: AES-256, Blow Fish, 3DES, Base64, and the Caesar Cipher. We don't expect to be updating this project anymore as the development phase is over. And unfortunately we weren't able to add the promised RSA as it didn't provide consistent results during testing. 

Oh, Ok. Well when do you expect to have a release out?
------------------------------------------------------

As we mentioned before, we will not be updating this program further than the current release (1.5.6). This branch is also protected until after the contest as to avoid getting DQed for editing after the deadline. 

Awesome! How can I help?
-----------------------

Sorry, if you are interested in writing some code, you can't. The contest that this program is being entered in does not allow external help. You can however test the program and report bugs, trust us, there are plenty.
