//this class will encrypt anything in the usrInput array.
//It should also have multiple encryption methods.
// It has not been decided who will program this.
//some forms of encrytion that we should look into is AES - 128, 256 we should also look into DES or 3DES as they are very secure. RSA also might be good to look into as well.
